In every jump map, the _jumps_ are the most important component--this is probably obvious. But there are lots of other components that go into good maps, one of which is _how the jumps are linked together_, and that's what we're talking about today.

# A Plan

Making a jump map is hard--there's a lot of things to get right if you want to make a map that people like, that people will want to spend their time on, or maybe even a map that will turn people into better jumpers. These maps aren't accidents: they're _planned_. And when you're planning your map, you won't get very far before you have to decide whether to link your jumps with _doors_ or _connectors_.

>You _can_ shoot from the hip and put together a map with little forethought, but when you think about your favorite maps--the memorable ones that had an effect on you--they're _probably_ not the ones someone slapped together haphazardly.

# Terminology

Once you complete a jump, where do you go? Do you walk into a brush that teleports to another room? Or do you keep walking down a hallway until you reach the next jump?

_Doors_ are when your jumps are physically isolated from one another, and the jumper is teleported from the end of one jump to the beginning of another. They're often represented with door-like brushes, but can be anything.

_Connectors_ are when the jumps are joined through hallways that the player can traverse themselves.

# Which is better?

The short answer is that "it depends," since they both have pros and cons. The important part is to weigh the options and decide for yourself what's best for your map. There is some opinion that doors are obsolete, but this is just that: opinion. Both have their place, so let's see what makes each useful.

# Doors are easier to build
